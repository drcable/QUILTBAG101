        </section>
        <section>

            However, you should be incredibly careful with using the word Queer to
            refer to other people.
          </h1>
          Many people feel that queer is insulting to them, or they do not fit

        </section>
        <section>
          <h1>
            Polyamory is 'consensual non-monogamy' - that is, a relationship
            can only be considered poly if everyone agrees.
          </h1>
          The opposite of this is non-consensual non-monogamy - I.E. cheating.

            Poly relationships allow the partners to have other romantic and/or
            sexual partners.
          </h1>
          Sometimes this means a partner is allowed to have sex as long as
          there's no romantic or emotional attachment. Other times they're
          allowed to form full relationships.
        </section>
        <section>
          <h1>
            There are many forms of Polyamorous relationship. Relationships can be
            negotiated and re-negotiated to fit the partners' needs.
          </h1>
          Boundaries often have to be renegotiated as
          the partners realise they are more or less comfortable with certain things.
        </section>
        <section>
          <h1>
            Different poly relationships will be more or less restrictive about the
            conditions of one of the partners having outside relations.
          </h1>
          These conditions might include having the right to veto a partners'
          partner and being informed (or never informed) of their partners'
          goings on.
        </section>
        <section>
          <h1>
            Polyamory isn't for everyone. It may not be for you, but don't judge

        <section>
          <h1>
            Don't assume anything. You can't tell a person's sexuality by who they're
            dating or who they've dated, for instance.

        </section>

          <h1>
            Use the pronouns that someone requests you use. If you're not sure about them,
            ask politely.
          </h1>
          Pronouns really aren't that hard to learn. Don't complain that
          they're "made up" or gramatically incorrect, just use them.

            Different QUILTBAG groups have different needs and problems. Be aware of this
            when dealing with them.
          </h1>
          There are also some problems that arise as a result of
          being several identities - this is known as intersectionality.

            If someone asks you not to talk about something because it's causing them
            distress, stop talking about it.

          When writing you should also use [trigger warnings](basic trigger
          warning description] to warn people about possibly distressing content.

          <h1>
            Don't ask intrusive questions. Just because a person is different, it doesn't
            mean they want to be asked awkward questions.
          </h1>
          This means: Don't ask trans people about their genitals, don't ask bi/pan
          people who they've slept with and so on.

    Bi and Pan sexuality

    <h1>
      Bisexuality is attraction to more than one gender. Pansexuality is
      attraction to all genders.
    </h1>
    The two can overlap, and these are not strict definitions. The
    person gets to decide what label/s they use - please respect that.
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>
      Bi/Pansexuals aren‚Äôt attracted to everyone, just have the capacity to
      be attracted to more genders.
    </h1>
    In the same way a gay or straight person isn‚Äôt attracted to all people
    of the same/‚Äùopposite‚Äù-gender.
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>
      Bi/Pansexuals aren‚Äôt promiscuous or more liable to cheat. Some are,
      but not because they‚Äôre bisexual.
    </h1>
    Neither trustworthiness nor preference for non-monogamy are related to
    sexual orientation.
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>
      Bi/Pansexuality is a valid orientation, not just a phase. It can be a
      phase for some, and that‚Äôs ok.

    <h1>
      They don‚Äôt necessarily want to have sex with you, or a threesome. They
      might do, but not because they‚Äôre bisexual.

  <section>
    <h1>
      A Bi/Pansexual doesn‚Äôt become gay or straight if they start a
      monogamous relationship.
    </h1>
    Sexual orientation doesn‚Äôt go away. Don't assume people's orientation
    based on what (or who) they are currently doing.

    Asexuality
  </h1>
  <section>
    <h1>
      Asexuality is a lack of sexual attraction to anyone. It is not the
      same as celibacy, the choice not to have sex.
    </h1>
    Asexuals often refer to themselves as "ace." Aromantic asexuals often
    use "aro-ace."
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>
      Asexuals are capable of having sex and masturbating - some do. Some
      ace people dislike sex, but others can enjoy it.
    </h1>
    Just because somone has sex, or enjoys it, It doesn't mean they're
    not asexual.
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>
      Asexuality is a spectrum. A grey-asexual (Grey-A) can include people
      who experience sexual attraction or a sex drive very rarely.

  <section>
    <h1>
      A Demisexual is a person who doesn't experience sexual attraction
      without a strong emotional connection.
    </h1>
    Demisexuals don't feel attraction to people without this bond, rather
    than making a choice not to have sex with them.

      Intersex people do not fit into a binary (male/female) model of sex*
      Approximately 1% of people fit the label "Intersex"(http://www.isna.org/faq/frequency)
    </h1>
    Sex isn't binary. Some people's bodies don't fit neatly into the
    "male" or "female" categories of sex.
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>
      To force the binary model of sex upon Intersex people they are often
      sterilized at a young age
    </h1>
    Preventing this is one of the primary struggles of intersex activists.

  <section>
    <h1>
      Sex refers to biological attributes - primary and secondary sexual
      characteristics, chromosomes and hormones.
    </h1>
    There are a number of ways you could define sex - a more
    comprehensive one takes into account a wide range of sex-determined
    characteristics.

  </h1>
  <section>
    <h1>
      Gender identity is a  persons sense of gender: whether they feel they
      are male, female of somthing else
    </h1>
    People who feel they are somthing else are called non-binary.
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>
      A person will have a gender assigned to them at birth. This will be
      the gender put on your (first) birth certificate.
    </h1>
    The gender assigned is usually based on the genitalia of the person at
    birth. In some cases, it's difficult to make a decision. See Intersex.
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>
      Transgender people are people who's gender are different to that to
      that they were assigned at birth.

    A person who's gender matches that assigned to them at birth is called

      Trans\* identities are a spectrum: there are more options than male or
      female, such as genderqueer.
    </h1>
    These are called "non-binary" genders. The traditional man/woman
    genders are not used in all societies.
  </section>

      Gender expression is how a person physically presents themselves. For

  <section>
    <h1>
      Some trans* people will undertake procedures such as surgery or hormone
      replacments.

    This does not make them "more trans". What procedures somone has undertaken are non of your buisness.
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>
      It's none of your business what procedures a trans person has
      undertaken
    </h1>
    Medical procedures are personal choice available to some trans* people,

    somone less trans

    Queer
  </h1>
  <section>
    <h1>
      Queer is a slur used to attack QUILTBAG+ people that some have adopted
      as an identity.
    </h1>
    Queer is a political, sexual and gender identity. It is often used in
    conjunction with other identities.
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>
      However, you should be incredibly careful with using the word Queer to
      refer to other people.
    </h1>
    Many people feel that queer is insulting to them, or they do not fit
    under the queer umbrella.
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>
      People use it as a term to refer to all politically marginialized
      gender and sexual identities.
    </h1>
    This includes trans* people, kinky people, and non-monsexual people.
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>
      Unsure is also part of the QUILTBAG acronym. People who are Unsure
      are unsure about their gender or sexual identity.

    Some people also use "questioning" in place of unsure.

    Poly
  </h1>
  <section>
    <h1>
      Polyamory literally means 'many loves' - it's a relationship
      structure that's inclusive of the partners having other partners..
    </h1>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>
      Polyamory is 'consensual non-monogamy' - that is, a relationship
      can only be considered poly if everyone agrees.
    </h1>
    The opposite of this is non-consensual non-monogamy - I.E. cheating.
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>
      Poly relationships allow the partners to have other romantic and/or
      sexual partners.
    </h1>
    Sometimes this means a partner is allowed to have sex as long as
    there's no romantic or emotional attachment. Other times they're
    allowed to form full relationships.
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>
      There are many forms of Polyamorous relationship. Relationships can be
      negotiated and re-negotiated to fit the partners' needs.
    </h1>
    Boundaries often have to be renegotiated as
    the partners realise they are more or less comfortable with certain things.
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>
      Different poly relationships will be more or less restrictive about the
      conditions of one of the partners having outside relations.
    </h1>
    These conditions might include having the right to veto a partners'
    partner and being informed (or never informed) of their partners'
    goings on.
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>
      Polyamory isn't for everyone. It may not be for you, but don't judge
      people on their preference either way.
    </h1>
  </section>

  <h1>
    To recap
  </h1>
  <section>
    <h1>
      Don't assume anything. You can't tell a person's sexuality by who they're
      dating or who they've dated, for instance.
    </h1>
  </section>
  Following this simple rule will result in a 99% reduction in the amount of
  times you put your foot in your mouth.
  <section>
    <h1>
      Use the pronouns that someone requests you use. If you're not sure about them,
      ask politely.
    </h1>
    Pronouns really aren't that hard to learn. Don't complain that
    they're "made up" or gramatically incorrect, just use them.
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>
      Different QUILTBAG groups have different needs and problems. Be aware of this
      when dealing with them.
    </h1>
    There are also some problems that arise as a result of
    being several identities - this is known as intersectionality.
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>
      If someone asks you not to talk about something because it's causing them
      distress, stop talking about it.
    </h1>
    When writing you should also use [trigger warnings](basic trigger
    warning description] to warn people about possibly distressing content.
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>
      Don't ask intrusive questions. Just because a person is different, it doesn't
      mean they want to be asked awkward questions.
    </h1>
    This means: Don't ask trans people about their genitals, don't ask bi/pan
    people who they've slept with and so on.

        Trans\* identities are a spectrum: there are more options than male or
        female, such as genderqueer.
    These are called "non-binary" genders. The traditional man/woman
    genders are not used in all societies.

        Some trans* people will undertake procedures such as surgery or hormone
        replacments.

        undertaken
    Medical procedures are personal choice available to some trans* people,
